About this blog

\### This content appears above the formatted about page content.

::: {#hero-heading}
I am a Bachelor of Science in Astronomy from the <a href="https://www.udea.edu.co" style="color:#0B351D; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Universidad de Antioquia</a>.

Recently I am a PhD. student in Astronomy at <a href="https://das.uchile.cl/" style="color:#003087; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Departamento de Astronomía, Universidad de Chile</a>.

I was born in Manizales (Colombia), one of the coffee world capitals. I moved to Medellin to study Astronomy. Aside from my professional work in astronomy, I also like hearing histories about the development of cities and civilizations during and after the independence centuries. In 2012 I entered Conservatorio de Música de la Universidad de Caldas, where I learned the basics to play guitar, reading scores, and a little choir. I want to practice choral music again. Also, I like the Rol/RPG games as table games as video games. If you are a new party, take me into account. 

I worked on my bachelor thesis: Spectral characterization of two host stars by the TIGRE telescope, and I was working on my project for [https://www.astroreca.org/internship-2021](RECA Internship 2021) Characterization of Progenitors and Explosions of Hydrogen-rich Supernovae
